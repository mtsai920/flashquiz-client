## Overview

FlashQuiz is a full-stack flashcard application where you can learn new words, or study for tests, or prepare for interviews, or any other studying you could think of. Users create collections of different studying topics, which hold as many cards as they need.

It uses MongoDB and Express for the backend, and React, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Axios for the frontend.
